# linnaeus-link-scrapy
Program to scrape the linnaeus link union catalog built using scrapy.

The scrapy library is here: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy

JSON converted to CSV using this: https://github.com/vinay20045/json-to-csv

I modified the settings file in scrapy slightly to slow down the crawl and to export as utf-8.
